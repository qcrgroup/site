  <h1>The Project:</h1>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
    In this research we assessed for the first time the synergies between two different approaches to the mitigation of online extremism: deplatforming of extremist users, the current gold standard, and inoculation, an emerging, non-invasive control protocol.     To do so, we developed an agent-based model of diffusion and control of online extremism informed by inoculation theory, which we informed with data from systematic reviews and  studies conducted in the field of terrorism research.

A population of Bayesian agents (exemplified by their belonging to an anti-immigration Facebook group) forms a binary belief about far-right content unilaterally spread by extremists embedded within the social network. We find that adding inoculation reduces the need for monitoring and deplatforming to control the spread of online extremism. Importantly, the study reveals that inoculation enhances societal resilience to contagion and improves the predictability and effectiveness of moderation strategies. The paper further develops a cost-benefit analysis, demonstrating the feasibility of assigning a monetary value to inoculation strategies and showing that inoculation can be an economically sustainable approach to the reduction of online extremism, providing insights into the potential subsidisation of inoculation policies or their sustainability through fines.

 <h3>Why Does it Matter?</h3>
    Our work has important implications for policy, as it highlights the effectiveness of shifting funds from repressive measures like monitoring and online surveillance to preventative inoculation strategies. Repressive tactics can trigger backlash and infringe on individual freedoms, potentially undermining trust in democratic institutions. In contrast, preventative methods led by civil society organisations promote democratic values by fostering community engagement, empowerment, and resilience. These strategies not only protect individual liberties but also strengthen societal resistance to extremism and have broader positive impacts. The research provides the first data-driven basis for policymakers to reallocate resources towards more democratic and sustainable counter-extremism approaches.
