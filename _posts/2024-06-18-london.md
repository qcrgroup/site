  <h1>The Project:</h1>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">

This research is part of a comprehensive research plan with London Metropolitan Police force aiming at identifying, measuring and moderating factors that lead to serious violence and knife crime  in the area of Greater London, with a focus on organized crime violence.

To study this type of crime, we took a geometrical approach and reconstructed the complete architecture of co-offending individuals for Greater London Area in years 2018-2022. Using an innovative multiplex network approach, we were able to reconstruct both the network of cooperation and the network of fights. Through this innovative approach, we predict crime behaviour, particularly violence, as a function of the ovserved behaviour of co-offending partners, victims and opponents.

 <h3>Why Does it Matter?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

We observed that gun, weapon and knife increase the expected severety of violence (as measured through the Cambridge Harm Index). Controlling for the type of crime, gun, weapon and knife, there is an additional, important, component-specific additional effect of 19%. This means that if a crime bridges two separate components, the expected harm is 19% higher than the baseline. In other words, violence across components is 19% more serious than violence within the same component or violence from a component to a single individual or from an individual to an individual. The size of a component marginally impacts the severity, but this is less relevant.
